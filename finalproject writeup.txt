**Please Return SD card**

This Build is sutable for any Raspberry Pi 3, or later models. 
Unfortunatly, I don't have access to my SD card, so I can't provide the name of every file. However, they are 
all contained on the pi/home folder of the SD card. 

Recipe.
-Setup and update Raspberry Pi 4.
-Create an Amazon Developer account.
-Go to Alexa Voice Service and input the details of your prototype.
-Download the AVS credentials it provides you to your Pi/Home folder.  

Recipe of code Needed for Raspberry Pi with Alexa.
(This will download additional files to the Pi/Home area of the SD.)

Notes
-When I started this project I thought it was going to be quite a stretch for me. However, due to excelent 
online instructions from Amazon themselves, it was surprisingly straightforward. The majority of the problems I
encountered were easily solved by deleting files that downloaded incorrectly, and reloading them. I did run into one 
problem that was harder to correct. It stemed from the fact that the program is designed to recieve audio input
from a usb microphone, which I didn't have. however, I did have access to a 3.5mm headset that includes a microphone, 
so I spent 2 hours on the forums investigating how to reprogram my Alexa raspberry pi to look for input from the 3.5mm 
jack. unfortunatly, because the code makes reference to the usb microphone in multiple places, scattered throughout the
entire code, this was an unrealistic goal. After purchasing a usb microphone the code functioned perfectly, and I was able
use Alexa voice service simple questions. As an extension of this project, I would plan to have students integrate bluetooth
finctionality so they can play music through youtube or spotify to bluetooth speakers. This is fairly easy using 
the suite of guides on the amazon developer app. Alternatly, students could program any number of functions to their Pi.
